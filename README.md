Just a small app to play around with Ramaze,
It's final purpose will be an app that copies passwords to the clipboard
and that only grant those passwords to users of the right access level.

In the meantime you can use this to see how to set up Sequel migrations with Ramaze with a rake task.

Rake code courtesy of the following gist https://gist.github.com/viking/1133150 

If you know how to improve any parts of this app please fork and submit a pull request.
